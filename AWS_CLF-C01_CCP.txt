SNAPSHOT
INCREMENTAL
POINT IN TIME RECOVERY
FULL backup
::
Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster during the backup window of your DB instance. RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of your DB instance, backing up the entire DB instance and not just individual databases. RDS saves the automated backups of your DB instance according to the backup retention period that you specify. If necessary, you can recover your DB instance to any point in time during the backup retention period.

Automated backups follow these rules:

Your DB instance must be in the available state for automated backups to occur. Automated backups don't occur while your DB instance is in a state other than available, for example, storage_full.
Automated backups don't occur while a DB snapshot copy is running in the same AWS Region for the same database.
You can also back up your DB instance manually by creating a DB snapshot.
The first snapshot of a DB instance contains the data for the full database. Subsequent snapshots of the same database are incremental, which means that only the data that has changed after your most recent snapshot is saved.

VPC and NETWORKING:===============================================================================
VPC=======================================
Virtual private cloud, private network to deploy resources regional; 
subnets: allow partition your network; 
Public S: accessible from Internet; 
private s: not accessible. 
Route tables: define access to Internet and between subnets. 
Internet gateway: vpc to connect to Internet, public subnets have route to it; 
Nat gateway: aws manage private subnets to access Internet 

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables routing using each VPC's private IP addresses as if they were in the same network. VPC peering connections can be created between your own VPCs or with a VPC in another AWS account. VPC peering also supports inter-region peering
You can peer any two VPCs in different Regions, as long as they have distinct, non-overlapping CIDR blocks.
This ensures that all of the private IP addresses are unique, and it allows all of the resources in the VPCs to address each other without the need for any form of network address translation
AWS ENI(elastic network interface)=======================================
An elastic network interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. It can include the following attributes: A primary private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC.

NAT Gateway=======================================
A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances
Security Groups:==============================================
acting as firewall, Regulate access to port; Authorized IP range v4 and v6; Control of inbound/outbound network.
port 22: ssh
Putty 
win10 cmd>>ssh -i .\EC2Tutorial.pcm ec2-user@3.250.26.200
EC2 Instance Connect
Network ACL=======================================
Access control list firewall control traffic from and to subnet.  Rules allow/deny rules include IP address security groups, firewall controls, traffic to and from ENI EC2 I only allow rules. Rules have ip addresses, other security groups. With a Network ACL you can block a specific IP address that would be coming inbound into your subnet. This would prevent a specific IP from gaining access if you suspected them of being a bad actor.
Your VPC comes with a default NACL configured to automatically allow all inbound and outbound network traffic

SG vs N ACL:
Security Groups  |;|	NACL
Firewall or protection of Instances	|;| Firewall or Protection of the Subnet
Security groups are (stateful) which means any changes  applied to incoming rule is also applied to outgoing rule |;|	These are (Stateless)
It is the first layer of defense or protection.  |;|	This is the second layer of defense and an additional layer of protection.
All the rules are applied to an (Instance).  |;|	SUBNET,In the case of NACL, the rules are applied in the order of their priority, wherein the priority is indicated by the rule number assigned.
All the rules are evaluated before they allow a Traffic  |;|   Rules are evaluated based on their priority
Security Groups vs Network Access Control Lists

Stateful vs Stateless
At instance level vs At subnet level
Only allows Allow rule vs Allows both Allow and Deny rules
Evaluated as a Whole vs Evaluated in defined Order

VPC Virtual Private Gateway=======================================
What is an AWS virtual private gateway?
Virtual private gateway: A virtual private gateway is the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of your Site-to-Site VPN connection that can be attached to a single VPC.
A virtual private gateway is a logical, fully redundant distributed edge routing function that sits at the edge of your VPC. As it is capable of terminating VPN connections from your on-prem or customer environments, the VPG is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.
VPC Flow Logs=======================================
captures info about IP traffic going to interface. VPC subnets, elastic network interfaces ; AWS service or feature can be used to capture information about inbound and outbound IP traffic on network interfaces in a VPC.
VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3. After you've created a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination.
Flow logs can help you with a number of tasks, such as:
  • Diagnosing overly restrictive security group rules
  • Monitoring the traffic that is reaching your instance
  • Determining the direction of the traffic to and from the network interfaces
Flow log data is collected outside of the path of your network traffic, and therefore does not affect network throughput or latency. You can create or delete flow logs without any risk of impact to network performance.

1. ondemand selfservice
2. broad network access
3. resource pooling and multiple tenancy
4. rapid elasticity and scalability
5. measured service
--------------
deployment models:
private: cloud infra provisioned for exclusively 1 organization with multiple consumers. owned managed operated by org,a third party, some cobination of both and may exists on or off prmises.

community: infra for exclusive use of community of consumers from org having shared concerns. owned ...
companies colaborating.

public: for open use by general public. owned,managed and operated by business,academic or gov org or combination. Exists on the premises of the cloud provider.

hybrid: composition of 2 or more above...
--------------
Cloud Service Models:

IaaS(infra): provision processing,storage,networks, ..os or app. not manage or cotrol the underlying infra but control over OS,storage,appl, limited control of networking comp(host firewalls). not need to manage physical infra/hardware, switches routers, datacenter,cooling etc. highest Flexibility.
{Amazon EC2, GCP, Azure, Rackspace}

PaaS(platform): to deploy onto cloud infra consumer created or acquired appl created by PL,lib,services and tools supported by the provider. consumer not manages underlying infra including network,servers,os,storage but has control over deployed appln and config for the appl hosting env.
removes the need for you to manage underlying structure(h/w, os), no worry  resource prcurement, capacity planning, s/w maintenance,patching etc.
heroku,aws ebs
{Elastic beanstalk EBS, google app engine}

SaaS(software): complete product that is run and managed by service provider.  End user appl(mail) dont think about how service is maintained or how underlying infra maintained, just how you will use s/w.
{aws services, gmail,zoom, dropbox}

Cloudront edge location Distribution AWS:
A distribution is made up of edge locations that you want to serve content from, and details about how that content will be tracked and managed. Edge groups and circulations are not cloud front concepts, and load balancer is an aws service that helps you to direct web traffic.
--------------------------
Amazon glacier key components: Access Policy, Vault, Archive. Data is organized in S3 into archives, and vaults are used to group archives together. Access policies control who can access the data. Buckets are a part of s3, but not glacier. VOlumes are often associated with hard disks and therefore EBS, while tables are db contructs.

--------------------------
AWS Service Health Dashboard:
allows you to learn about the availability and operations of AWS services and to view personalised communication about your resources/accounts (like resources taken down for repairs, upgrades or maintenance). THIS DISPLAYS THE GENERAL STATUS OF THE SERVICES NEX ONE IS USEFUL.

It integrates with Event Bridge to send notifications, execute lambda functions and so on.
--------------------------
AWS personal Health dashboard:
Gives personalized view into the performance and availability of the aws services underlying the aws resources, alerting u and providing remediation when AWS IS EXPERIENCING EVENTS THAT MAY AFFECT YOU.
--------------------------
Which aws load balancer types uses a round robin load sitribution strategy:
the classes uses for TCP listeners only
the ALB 1st select target based on routing rule then uses RR strategy to select a node.
--------------------------
2019 URL structure for object in s3:: https, then the bucket name, then dot, then aws s3 regional endpoint, then slash, then the object name: https://my-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/key-name

--------------------------
Amazon Transcribe(speechToText): Amazon Transcribe is an AWS Artificial Intelligence (AI) service that makes it easy for you to convert speech to text.
--------------------------
Amazon Comprehend: a fully managed, continuously trained NLP service backed by ML, used to derive meaningful data from any text in utf-8 format or semi-structured document as .doc or .pdf. Amazon Comprehend uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights about the content of documents. It develops insights by recognizing the entities, key phrases, language, sentiments, and other common elements in a document.
--------------------------
AMAZON POLLY(voice): Amazon Polly uses deep learning technologies to synthesize natural-sounding human speech, so you can convert articles to speech. With dozens of lifelike voices across a broad set of languages, use Amazon Polly to build speech-activated applications.
--------------------------
AWS cloudwatch: Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service that provides data and actionable insights for AWS, on-premises, hybrid, and other cloud applications and infrastructure resources. You can collect and access all your performance and operational data in the form of logs and metrics from a single platform rather than monitoring them in silos (server, network, or database). CloudWatch enables you to monitor your complete stack (applications, infrastructure, network, and services) and use alarms, logs, and events data to take automated actions and reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR). This frees up important resources and allows you to focus on building applications and business value.

CloudWatch gives you actionable insights that help you optimize application performance, manage resource utilization, and understand system-wide operational health.
--------------------------
AWS shield: AWS Shield is a managed distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. It provides dynamic detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency, so there is no need to engage AWS Support to benefit from DDoS protection.
THIS COMES WITH AWS WAF WITH NO EXTRA COST.
--------------------------
aws network firewall:
AWS Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for your virtual private cloud (VPC) that you create in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses the open source intrusion prevention system (IPS), Suricata, for stateful inspection.

Both web-based and network solutions work at different layers and protect from different types of traffic. So rather than competing, they complement each other. A network firewall typically protects a wider range of traffic types, whereas a WAF deals with a specific threat that the traditional approach cannot cover.
--------------------------
AWS inspector:
Amazon Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure
--------------------------
AWS Guard duty:
Amazon GuardDuty is a real-time threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) workloads, container applications, Amazon Aurora databases, and data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). It uses an established baseline and updated continuous threat intelligence (think of a catalog of malevolent IP addresses) to find and respond to threats within your AWS environment.
GuardDuty collects and analyzes data from three sources (AWS CloudTrail Event logs, VPC Flow logs, and DNS logs) to detect unexpected or unwanted behavior, deliver findings, and even offer some immediate, pre-programmed remediation. The tool identifies three types of AWS cloud threats:

Attacker reconnaissance: Failed login patterns, odd API activity, and port scanning could indicate such action.
Compromised resources: Cryptojacking, anomalous surges in network traffic, and temporary access to Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances via an external IP address are all potential harbingers for such a compromise.
Compromised accounts: API calls from an unexpected location, attempts to disable CloudTrail, and unusual instance or infrastructure deployments are examples of possibly compromised accounts.
--------------------------
AWS keymanagement service:
AWS Key Management Service (KMS) gives you centralized control over the cryptographic keys used to protect your data. The service is integrated with other AWS services making it easier to encrypt data you store in these services and control access to the keys that decrypt it
--------------------------
AWS WAF:
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from attacks by allowing you to configure rules that allow, block, or monitor (count) web requests based on conditions that you define
--------------------------
AWS costExplorer:
AWS Cost Explorer lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. You can analyze your cost and usage data at a high level (for example, total costs and usage across all accounts in your organization) or for highly specific requests (for example, m2.2xlarge costs within account Y that are tagged project: secretProject). You can dive deeper into your reservations using the Reserved Instance utilization and coverage reports.
--------------------------
Amazon Rekognition:
Scalable image analysis – Amazon Rekognition enables you to analyze millions of images so you can curate and organize massive amounts of visual data. Analyze and filter images based on image properties – Amazon Rekognition lets you analyze image properties like quality or colors.
--------------------------
Amazon SageMaker Model Training
Amazon SageMaker reduces the time and cost to train and tune ML models at scale without the need to manage infrastructure. Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly.
--------------------------
AWS EC2 is a pay-as-you-use service. You only pay for the compute time that you use. 
AWS EC2 pricing is based on an hourly rate. You can pay by the hour or second, with a minimum of 60 seconds
--------------------------
AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog that customers can use to find, buy, deploy, and manage third-party software, data, and services to build solutions and run their businesses.
--------------------------
The Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly accessible in-memory cache for Amazon DynamoDB that improves performance by up to ten times—from milliseconds to microseconds—even when millions of requests per second are made. DAX takes care of all the heavy lifting when it comes to adding in-memory acceleration to DynamoDB tables, so developers don’t have to worry about cache invalidation, data populating, or cluster management. DAX is built to work in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). Amazon VPC defines a virtual network that strongly resembles a conventional data center. A VPC’s IP address range, subnets, routing tables, network gateways, and security settings are all within your control. Using Amazon VPC security groups, you may build a DAX cluster on your virtual network and control access to it.
--------------------------
What is AWS Redshift Used for? AWS Redshift is a data warehouse product built by Amazon Web Services. It's used for large scale data storage and analysis, and is frequently used to perform large database migrations
--------------------------
Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB)
Amazon QLDB tracks each and every application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.
--------------------------
IAM: Identity and Access Management global service. Creates users and assign them to groups. Root account created by default shouldnt be used or shared. IAM policies JSON document define permissions for an action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. For example, if a policy allows the GetUser action, then a user with that policy can get user information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API.
FOLLOW LEAST PRIVILEAGE princilple.

Groups are for creating logical sets of users which should have given permissions
The difference between IAM roles and policies in AWS is that a role is a type of IAM identity that can be authenticated and authorized to utilize an AWS resource, whereas a policy defines the permissions of the IAM identity

With IAM Roles you can delegate permissions to resources for users and services without using permanent credentials (e.g. username and password). To do so you can create a role and assign an IAM policy to the role that has the permissions required.
 "IAM Policy" is incorrect. An IAM policy is a policy document that is used to define permissions that can be applied to users, groups and roles. You don’t apply the policy to the service, you apply it to the role. The role is then used to assign permissions to the AWS service.


Explanation
This is the list of valid IAM best practices:

• Lock away your AWS account root user access keys
• Create individual IAM users
• Use groups to assign permissions to IAM users
• Grant least privilege
• Get started using permissions with AWS managed policies
• Use customer managed policies instead of inline policies
• Use access levels to review IAM permissions
• Configure a strong password policy for your users
• Enable MFA
• Use roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances
• Use roles to delegate permissions
• Do not share access keys
• Rotate credentials regularly
• Remove unnecessary credentials
• Use policy conditions for extra security
• Monitor activity in your AWS account
• Video presentation about IAM best practices

On-Demand Capacity Reservation:
On-Demand Capacity Reservation with Savings Plan is ideal in this scenario as the application will have predictable running times (every Monday from 6am till 10pm). It is also mission critical, so reserving the capacity within an Availability Zone using On-Demand Capacity Reservation with Savings Plan makes perfect sense. The savings plans will also make this application cost-effective whilst still maintaining the guaranteed availability that you cannot get with spot instances.

6 Application Migration Strategies: “The 6 R's” ; 2. Replatforming — I sometimes call this “lift-tinker-and-shift.” ; 3. Repurchasing — Moving to a different product. ; 4. Refactoring / Re-architecting — Re-imagining how the application is architected and developed, typically using cloud-native features. ; 5. Retire — Get rid of. ; 6. Retain — Usually this means “revisit” or do nothing (for now).

NETWORKING CHEAT SHEET:

VPC
helps define a logically isolated dedicated virtual network within the AWS
provides control of IP addressing using CIDR block from a minimum of /28 to maximum of /16 block size
Components
Internet gateway (IGW) provides access to the Internet
Virtual gateway (VGW) provides access to on-premises data center through VPN and Direct Connect connections
VPC can have only one IGW and VGW
Route tables determine where network traffic from subnet is directed
Ability to create subnet with VPC CIDR block
A Network Address Translation (NAT) server provides outbound Internet access for EC2 instances in private subnets
Elastic IP addresses are static, persistent public IP addresses
Instances launched in the VPC will have a Private IP address and can have a Public or a Elastic IP address associated with it
Security Groups and NACLs help define security
Flow logs – Capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC
allows Tenancy option for instances

shared
, by default, allows instances to be launched on shared tenancy

dedicated allows instances to be launched on a dedicated hardware
NAT

allows internet access to instances in private subnet
performs the function of both address translation and port address translation (PAT)
needs source/destination check flag to be disabled as it is not actual destination of the traffic
NAT gateway is a AWS managed NAT service that provides better availability, higher bandwidth, and requires less administrative effort
Route Tables

defines rules, termed as routes, which determine where network traffic from the subnet would be routed
Each VPC has a Main Route table, and can have multiple custom route tables created
Every route table contains a local route that enables communication within a VPC which cannot be modified or deleted
Route priority is decided by matching the most specific route in the route table that matches the traffic
Subnets

map to AZs and do not span across AZs
have a CIDR range that is a portion of the whole VPC.
CIDR ranges cannot overlap between subnets within the VPC.
AWS reserves 5 IP addresses in each subnet – first 4 and last one
Each subnet is associated with a route table which define its behavior
Public subnets – inbound/outbound Internet connectivity via IGW
Private subnets – outbound Internet connectivity via an NAT or VGW
Protected subnets – no outbound connectivity and used for regulated workloads
Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

a default ENI, eth0, is attached to an instance which cannot be detached with one or more secondary detachable ENIs (eth1-ethn)
has primary private, one or more secondary private, public, Elastic IP address, security groups, MAC address and source/destination check flag attributes associated
AN ENI in one subnet can be attached to an instance in the same or another subnet, in the same AZ and the same VPC
Security group membership of an ENI can be changed
with pre allocated Mac Address can be used for applications with special licensing requirements
Security Groups vs Network Access Control Lists

Stateful vs Stateless
At instance level vs At subnet level
Only allows Allow rule vs Allows both Allow and Deny rules
Evaluated as a Whole vs Evaluated in defined Order
Elastic IP
is a static IP address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
is associated with AWS account , and not a particular instance
can be remapped from one instance to an other instance
is charged for non usage , if not linked for any instance or instance associated is in stopped state
VPC Peering
allows routing of traffic between the peer VPCs using private IP addresses and no IGW or VGW required
No single point of failure and bandwidth bottlenecks
VPC peering across regions is now supported. Refer
IP space or CIDR blocks cannot overlap
cannot be transitive, one-to-one relationship between two VPC
Only one between any two VPCs and have to be explicitly peered
Private DNS values cannot be resolved
Security groups from peered VPC cannot be referred for ingress and egress rules in security group, use CIDR block instead
VPC Endpoints
enables creation of a private connection between VPC and another AWS service (currently only S3) using its private IP address
does not require a public IP address, access over the Internet, NAT device, a VPN connection or AWS Direct Connect
traffic between VPC & AWS service does not leave the Amazon network
do not support cross-region requests
cannot be extended out of a VPC i.e. resources across the VPN, VPC peering, AWS Direct Connect connection cannot use the endpoint
Direct Connect & VPN
VPN
provide secure IPSec connections from on-premise computers or services to AWS over the Internet
is quick to setup, is cheap however it depends on the Internet speed
Direct Connect
is a network service that provides an alternative to using Internet to utilize AWS services by using private dedicated network connection
provides Virtual Interfaces
Private VIF to access instances within an VPC via VGW
Public VIF to access non VPC services
requires time to setup probably months, and should not be considered as an option if turnaround time is less
does not provide redundancy , use either second direct connection or IPSec VPN connection
Virtual Private Gateway is on the AWS side and Customer Gateway is on the Customer side
route propagation is enabled on VGW and not on CGW
Direct Connect vs VPN IPSec
Expensive to Setup and Takes time vs Cheap & Immediate
Dedicated private connections vs Internet
Reduced data transfer rate vs Internet data transfer cost
Consistent performance vs Internet inherent variability
Do not provide Redundancy vs Provides Redundancy
Route 53
Highly available and scalable DNS & Domain Registration Service
Reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications
Supports multi-region and backup architectures for High availability. ELB , limited to region, does not support multi region HA architecture
supports private Intranet facing DNS service
internal resource record sets only work for requests originating from within the VPC and currently cannot extend to on-premise
Global propagation of any changes made to the DN records within ~ 1min
Route 53 to create an alias resource record set that points to ELB, S3, CloudFront. An alias resource record set is an Route 53 extension to DNS. It’s similar to a CNAME resource record set, but supports both for root domain – zone apex
e.g. example.com , and for subdomains for e.g. www.example.com.
CNAME resource record sets can be created only for subdomains and cannot be mapped to the zone apex record
Routing policy
Simple routing – simple round robin policy
Weighted round robin – assign weights to resource records sets to specify the proportion for e.g. 80%:20%
Latency based routing – helps improve global applications as request are sent to server from the location with minimal latency, is based on the latency and cannot guarantee users from the same geographic will be served from the same location for any compliance reasons
Geolocation routing – Specify geographic locations by continent, country, state limited to US, is based on IP accuracy
Failover routing – failover to a backup site if the primary site fails and becomes unreachable
Weighted, Latency and Geolocation can be used for Active-Active while Failover routing can be used for Active-Passive multi region architecture
